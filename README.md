#  Project 3 ‚Äì Part 1: **Scanner**
**Course:** CS 315 ‚Äî Fall 2025  
**Student:** Kevin Rodriguez 
**Student ID:** 008858727
**Instructor:** Prof. Ali Kooshesh

---

## üìò Overview
This project implements the **tokenization phase** of a Huffman-coding pipeline.  
The program reads a plain-text input file, normalizes it to lowercase, extracts valid **word tokens** according to the project specification, and writes each token on its own line to a `.tokens` file in the same directory.

This submission covers **Part 1 ‚Äì Scanner** only.  
Later phases (BST, frequency list, Huffman tree) will build upon this component.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Instructions
Compile all source files with **C++20** support:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -Wall *.cpp -o huffman_part1
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Instructions
Run the executable with **exactly one argument**, the path to an input `.txt` file in the `input_output/` directory:

```bash
./huffman_part1 input_output/the_call_of_the_wild.txt
```

### Example Output Files
After successful execution, the following file will be created:

```
input_output/the_call_of_the_wild.tokens
```

Each line in `.tokens` contains a single lowercase word token, stripped of punctuation, digits, dashes, and non-ASCII characters, with only internal apostrophes preserved (e.g., `camp's`, `o'keefe`).

---

## üß© Tokenization Rules (Summary)
- Convert input to lowercase (ASCII only).
- Valid tokens: `[a‚Äìz]+` or `[a‚Äìz]+‚Äô[a‚Äìz]+` (apostrophe only between letters).
- Treat digits, punctuation, quotes, whitespace, and dashes as separators.
- Remove leading/trailing apostrophes.
- Write **exactly one token per line**, end file with a newline.
- Return appropriate `error_type` values on failure.

---

## üß™ Testing
The project was compiled and tested on **blue** using the provided scripts:

```bash
bash compile_and_test.bash the_call_of_the_wild.txt
```

Output matched the reference results (no `diff` output).

## üßæ Error Handling
- **FILE_NOT_FOUND**, **DIR_NOT_FOUND**, **UNABLE_TO_OPEN_FILE**
- **UNABLE_TO_OPEN_FILE_FOR_WRITING**, **FAILED_TO_WRITE_FILE**
- Prints human-readable message to `stderr` and exits non-zero.

## ‚úÖ Verification
- Successfully produces identical `.tokens` outputs to instructor references.
- Matches tokenization examples from the project description.

# üñ•Ô∏è Proof of Successful Execution

Below is a transcript of my test runs on blue showing successful compilation,
execution, and matching outputs (no differences found by the provided test script).

**I learned more about casting**

| Reason for cast                | Example                                | Why it matters                               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Make bytes non-negative        | `unsigned char uc = (unsigned char)c;` | Avoid negative values for non-ASCII bytes    |
| Feed safely to ctype functions | `std::tolower(uc)`                     | Prevent undefined behavior                   |
| Compare against ASCII range    | `uc <= 127`, `uc >= 'A' && uc <= 'Z'`  | Guarantees consistent results across systems |
